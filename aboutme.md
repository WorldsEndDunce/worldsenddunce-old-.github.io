subtitle: "Learning for the sake of learning."

Hello! I'm Allison, and I'm currently a first-year undergraduate at Stanford University and a freelance tutor. I'm technically undeclared, but I plan on double majoring in computer science along with music. Some fields I'm interested in are neuroscience, biomedical engineering, BCIs, and machine learning. 
Recently, I've gotten into Android app development and writing math proofs (they're like fun logic puzzles). This summer, I'll be doing research at the CS department at Stanford as a CURIS fellow.

### My story

I was born at a very young age (like, 0 or something) in Wichita, Kansas. I learned how to play the piano as a kid and still study it in college. My favorite classical composer is probably Debussy because of all the color he puts in his pieces. On the J-pop side, I enjoy artists like Eve and Kikuo. In general, I like piano, Java, video games, to learn, drinking coffee, parallelism, and anime.
