Hello! I'm Allison, and I'm a rising sophomore at Stanford University. I'm technically undeclared, but I plan on double majoring in math and music with a co-term in computer science. Some fields I'm interested in are neuroscience, biomedical engineering, BCIs, and machine learning. This summer, I've been doing research at the [Brains in Silicon Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/){:target="_blank"} at Stanford as a CURIS fellow. You can check out the work I've done [here](https://worldsenddunce.github.io/research/)!

### My story

I was born at a very young age (like, 0 or something) in Wichita, Kansas. I learned how to play the piano as a kid and continue to tickle the ivories in college. My favorite classical composer is probably Debussy because of all the color he puts in his pieces. On the J-pop side, I enjoy artists like Mili and Kikuo. In general, I like piano, running, video games, to learn, drinking coffee, parallelism, and anime.
