Hello! I'm Allison, and I'm a double major in math and music with a co-term in computer science at Stanford University. Some fields I'm interested in are neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and machine learning. I've been doing research at the [Brains in Silicon Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/){:target="_blank"} at Stanford. You can check out the work I've done [here](https://worldsenddunce.github.io/research/)!

### My story

I was born at a very young age (like, 0 or something) in Wichita, Kansas. I learned how to play the piano as a kid and continue to tickle the ivories in college. My favorite classical composer is probably Debussy because of all the color he puts in his pieces. On the J-pop side, I enjoy artists like [Mili](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeBQMVnmr2Y){:target="_blank"} and Kikuo. In general, I like piano, video games, biking, to learn, drinking coffee, parallelism, and anime.
