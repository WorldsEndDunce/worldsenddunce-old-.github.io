Hello! I'm Allison, and I'm a rising sophomore at Stanford University and a freelance tutor. I'm technically undeclared, but I plan on double majoring in math and music with a co-term in computer science. Some fields I'm interested in are neuroscience, biomedical engineering, BCIs, and machine learning. 
Recently, I've gotten into website design and Elden Ring. This summer, I'm doing research at the [Brains in Silicon Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/){:target="_blank"} at Stanford as a CURIS fellow.

### My story

I was born at a very young age (like, 0 or something) in Wichita, Kansas. I learned how to play the piano as a kid and still study it in college. My favorite classical composer is probably Debussy because of all the color he puts in his pieces. On the J-pop side, I enjoy artists like Eve and Kikuo. In general, I like piano, Java, video games, to learn, drinking coffee, parallelism, and anime.
