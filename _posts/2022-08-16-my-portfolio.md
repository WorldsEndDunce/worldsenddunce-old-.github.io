### [**KittyChat**](https://devpost.com/software/kittychat-catgpt-for-language-learning){:target="_blank"}
Collaborated with a team to design and build a web application to make language conversation practice more accessible, featuring ChatGPT-powered talking cat baristas. Uses HTML/CSS/JS, Python, and OpenAI's GPT-3 and Whisper APIs.

### [**Zoo of Distributions**](https://zoo-of-distributions.github.io/){:target="_blank"}
Used HTML/CSS/JS to create a generative art website to teach probability distributions in a visual and engaging way. This project (along with a video demo and written report) won the Grand Prize for Stanford's CS109 Probability Contest.

### [**Do Neural Networks Dream of an Efficient PNG Search Algorithm?**](https://www.allisonxtee.com/research/){:target="_blank"}
Using Python and Julia, simulated spiking neural networks with differential equations and developed an improved algorithm to find polychronous neuronal groups (PNGs) representing memories in these networks. Check out my research page for more info!

### [**Mario Kart Wii AI**](https://github.com/WorldsEndDunce/MKWii-CNN){:target="_blank"}
Collaborated with a classmate to train a convolutional neural network to drive around a racetrack in Mario Kart Wii on an emulator. Presented development and results in a paper and video. Used Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

### **Grocery Store Simulator**
Used Java to program a Grocery Store Simulator, emulating multiple objects like registers, queues, and groceries. Used data structures and optimization methods to design the most efficient and profitable store.

### [**Robotics Engineering Notebook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xM8CXxxQqMyq4cRdJgjhIZt7fiYqd4VER3ynmn-LDfY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
I co-authored the Wichita Collegiate robotics team engineering notebook for the 2019 season. The task was to design and build a robot to succeed in repairing power lines and cleaning up debris on a game field simulating a post-natural disaster situation. Our "company" was named Watt's Up (power lines.)
