## Freshman Year
### Fall Quarter (17 units)
I heard figuring out Stanford was 3 units in itself, so this quarter I tested the waters with some classics (CS 106B and Math 51).<br>
**Programming Abstractions (CS 106B- 5 units):**<br>
Wow, this class was big. But then again, many college classes are. Many of my classmates seemed to already be experts at algorithms, so the exams were tough. I myself had around 2 years of Java experience when I took 106B (AP CSA and Data Structures). The assignments were a significant time investment (10-15 hours a week), and I knew others who took much longer. I think 106B is a solid overview of "interview"-esque programming topics. Looking back, I wish the assignment grades were more transparent and the online exams were C++ files.<br>
**Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Modern Applications (MATH 51- 5 units):**<br>
The math classes at Stanford go fast. I liked this class and the way Linear Algebra is presented, as the homework questions are a nice balance between "straight from the book" and "write me an essay." The professor had detailed notes for us, but one qualm I had was that often, she would take too much time with the first few topics and have to rush through the rest of the content when there wasn't much time left in class. The exam problems were much harder than any math problem I've ever done in school, but they're reasonable and really make you dig deep into your knowledge (or lack thereof). Another thing to watch out for is if students score too well on the first one or two exams (B+ to A average), the next test is usually killer.<br>
**Our Genome (THINK 68- 4 units):**<br>
The professor for the class (Gil Chu) is very nice, and the discussions focus on a plethora of biology-related topics like eugenics, CRISPR, abortion, and sperm donation. The content covered is interesting, though despite the focus on ethics, many conversations seemed one-sided. Overall, the coursework isn't bad for 4 units, with regular textbook readings and writing assignments.<br>
**SSEA + SSEA Seminar (ENGR 2(A)- 2 + 1 units):**<br>
The Stanford Summer Engineering Academy (SSEA) program was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life. You get to meet your future classmates, take trips around the Bay Area, explore campus, and listen to a lot of cool speakers. The classes (a tasting of 106A or B and Math 51) don't really prepare you for the intensity of their actual counterparts, but they help you get acquainted with some of their concepts. The directors and RAs of SSEA are very friendly and helpful and will keep in contact with you long after the program ends. 10/10, would recommend.
