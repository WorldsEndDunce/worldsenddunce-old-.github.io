## Freshman Year
### Fall Quarter (17 units)
I heard figuring out Stanford was 3 units in itself, so this quarter I tested the waters with some classics (CS 106B and Math 51).<br>
**Programming Abstractions (CS 106B- 5 units):**<br>
Wow, this class was big. But then again, many college classes are. Many of my classmates seemed to already be experts at algorithms, so the exams were tough. I myself had around 2 years of Java experience when I took 106B (AP CSA and Data Structures). The assignments were a significant time investment (10-15 hours a week), and I knew others who took much longer. I think 106B is a solid overview of "interview"-esque programming topics. Looking back, I wish the assignment grades were more transparent and the online exams were C++ files.<br>
**Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Modern Applications (MATH 51- 5 units):**<br>
The math classes at Stanford go fast. I liked this class and the way Linear Algebra is presented, as the homework questions are a nice balance between "straight from the book" and "write me an essay." The professor had detailed notes for us, but one qualm I had was that often, she would take too much time with the first few topics and have to rush through the rest of the content when there wasn't much time left in class. The exam problems were much harder than any math problem I've ever done in school, but they're reasonable and really make you dig deep into your knowledge (or lack thereof). Another thing to watch out for is if students score too well on the first one or two exams (B+ to A average), the next test is usually killer.<br>
**Our Genome (THINK 68- 4 units):**<br>
The professor for the class (Gil Chu) is very nice, and the discussions focus on a plethora of biology-related topics like eugenics, CRISPR, abortion, and sperm donation. The content covered is interesting, though despite the focus on ethics, many conversations seemed one-sided. Overall, the coursework isn't bad for 4 units, with regular textbook readings and writing assignments.<br>
**SSEA + SSEA Seminar (ENGR 2(A)- 2 + 1 units):**<br>
The Stanford Summer Engineering Academy (SSEA) program was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life. You get to meet your future classmates, take trips around the Bay Area, explore campus, and listen to a lot of cool speakers. The classes (a tasting of 106A or B and Math 51) don't really prepare you for the intensity of their actual counterparts, but they help you get acquainted with some of their concepts. The directors and RAs of SSEA are very friendly and helpful and will keep in contact with you long after the program ends. 10/10, would recommend.
### Winter Quarter (20 units)
**Mathematical Foundations of Computing (CS 103- 5 units)**<br>
I may be biased because I love proofs, but this was my first formal proof-writing class. I think it's a great introduction to them, though I know many people who don't like how the class is super picky with wording and emphasizes meticulosity (ex: forgetting to use "arbitrary" or messing up one word in a definition). The problem sets take a long time, but your homework will look very nice written in LaTeX. <br>
**Differential Equations with Linear Algebra, Fourier Methods, and Modern Applications (MATH 53- 5 units)**<br>
Another very fast math class. It's very easy to get lost during the last few chapters about Fourier and basic partial diff eqs. My friends who also took the class recommend office hours for the problem sets. And as for many math + p-set heavy classes, try to find a group to study with. The material covered turned out to be very useful for my neurocomputation research, though if you're more of a CS person, maybe taking another linear algebra class would be better. I liked this class though-- diff eqs are very cool.<br>
**Writing & Rhetoric 1: Numbers, Metrics, and Counting: The Rhetoric of Quantitative Thinking (PWR 1MGE- 4 units)**<br>
I was lucky to get a chill and lenient teacher for this one, though it's hit or miss with PWR intensity. Expect three major assignments (a few thousand words) and a smattering of readings in between. It seems like all the CS buffs take this one (probably because it has "quantitative" in the name), so it's a good class if you're allergic to Humanities. If you're not though, it's worth putting effort into the readings and writings too.<br>
**Music History 1600-1830 (MUSIC 41- 4 units)**<br>
Very small class, less than 10 people. There's basically a mini-response due every class (3 times a week), but the associated reading or watching is old stuff and takes around an hour or two (unless you skim it :^). All of these little assignments combined (with a few group projects and bigger assignments) made this class more work than my PWR. The classes are basically all discussions too (but why did they have to make them one and a half hours long?). I considered myself already pretty knowledgable about music history, but I sure did learn a lot more about Baroque and Classical music history though.<br>
**Advanced Piano (MUSIC 272A- 2 units)**<br>
It's just piano lessons. Nice teacher. I played a movement of a Haydn Sonata and Debussy's Prelude No. 9 (The Interrupted Serenade).<br>
### Spring Quarter (20 units) // TODO
**Computer Organization and Systems (CS 107- 5 units)**<br>
**Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists (CS 109- 5 units)**<br>
**Computer Science Research (CS 197- 3 units)**<br>
**Music History Since 1830 (MUSIC 42- 4 units)**<br>
**Advanced Piano (MUSIC 272A- 2 units)**<br>
**Piano Literature (MUSIC 155A- 1 unit)**<br>
