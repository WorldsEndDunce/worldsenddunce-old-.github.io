- **Grocery Store Simulator**
  Used Java to program a Grocery Store Simulator, emulating multiple objects like registers, queues, and groceries. Used optimization methods from calculus to design the most efficient   register and store.
- [**Robotics Engineering Notebook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xM8CXxxQqMyq4cRdJgjhIZt7fiYqd4VER3ynmn-LDfY/edit?usp=sharing) 
  I co-authored the Wichita Collegiate robotics team engineering notebook for the 2019 season. The task was to design and build a robot to succeed in repairing power lines and cleaning   up debris on a game field simulating a post-natural disaster situation. Our "company" was named Watt's Up (power lines.) ![Watt's Up](/assets/img/watts-up.png)
