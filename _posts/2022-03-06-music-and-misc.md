## Here's me playing the piano and various percussion instruments:

A recording of me playing Chopin's Black Key Etude that I submitted to the Kansas State Piano Festival and received a I rating for. I also performed this piece at a few other in-person events.

Here's a clip of Moszkowski's Etude No. 11 in Ab Major. This is one of the two pieces I played for the Senseney Schneider Piano Competition where I won 2nd place.

I participated in my high school's percussion ensemble and the smaller percussion quintet that played this particular piece (Rhyme or Reason). In Rhyme or Reason, I played a double marimba and tambourine part. In another piece we played called Aether, I performed with four mallets (two in each hand!). Our group received multiple I ratings at regional and state competitions.

## And some light reading:

A short piece about Euclid and Geometry. Sadly, the links to the formulas are broken.
