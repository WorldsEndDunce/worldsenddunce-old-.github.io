Here's me playing Moszkowski's Etude No. 11 in Ab Major. This is one of the two pieces I played for the Senseney Schneider Piano Competition where I won 2nd place.

## And some light reading:
### [SAT Mock Reading Passage](https://wcshemispheres.wordpress.com/hemispheres-2021/sat-reading-section-a-college-board-exposee/)
A piece satirizing the College Board modeled after a typical SAT reading passage. Published online in my high school's literary magazine.
### [Thee Distance Formula (in Response to "The Distance Formula")](https://wcshemispheres.wordpress.com/hemispheres/the-distance-formula/)
A short piece about Euclid and Geometry. Sadly, the links to the formulas are broken.
