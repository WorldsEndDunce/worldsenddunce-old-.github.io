### **Grocery Store Simulator**
Used Java to program a Grocery Store Simulator, emulating multiple objects like registers, queues, and groceries. Used data structures and optimization methods from calculus to design the most efficient and profitable store.
### [**Robotics Engineering Notebook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xM8CXxxQqMyq4cRdJgjhIZt7fiYqd4VER3ynmn-LDfY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
I co-authored the Wichita Collegiate robotics team engineering notebook for the 2019 season. The task was to design and build a robot to succeed in repairing power lines and cleaning up debris on a game field simulating a post-natural disaster situation. Our "company" was named Watt's Up (power lines.)
